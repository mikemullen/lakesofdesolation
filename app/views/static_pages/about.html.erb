<h1>About The Lakes of Desolation</h1>

  <div class="mainquote">It is a way I have of driving off the spleen, and regulating the circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth; whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul; whenever I find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses, and bringing up the rear of every funeral I meet; and especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street, and methodically knocking people's hats off--then, I account it high time to get to <span class="strike">sea</span> [the mountains] as soon as I can. - Herman Melville</div>

  <div class="about-text"><p>I grew up on the North Shore of Lake Tahoe with a view of the eastern peaks of Desolation Wilderness from my childhood home. Despite spending 18 years within site of Desolation Wilderness much of it remained unexplored. There was great hiking, skiing and hiking out the back door of my house, so I visited only a couple of the lakes in Desolation Wilderness. After being away from Tahoe and the mountains for 14 years I moved back to San Francisco and started to visit Tahoe now as a tourist. I was thrilled to visit Eagle Lake above Emerald Bay for the first time on a visit with my wife in 2012, and shortly after a spring hike to Lake Genevieve and Crag Lake cemented my interest in and love of the area.</p>

<p>Oddly, it took years of city and low-land living to give me a true appreciation of the mountains in which I spent my youth. Now walking and exploring the mountains is where I feel the most at home. A peace, and completeness that I cannot find in other places or pursuits fills me when I set foot on a trail leading up to a lake or mountain.</p>

<p>“The Lakes of Desolation” was born from these feelings of connection and completeness. My goal is to visit and photograph each of the named lakes in Desolation Wilderness, documenting as many of the un-named lakes I can find along the way. This site will be a catalog of these photographs as well as a collection of trail essays and miscellaneous related information. As a whole I see the project as a record of my experiences of Desolation Wilderness. It is my hope that parts of this project will be of interest or possibly help to others who enjoy Desolation Wilderness.</p>
